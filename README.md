These are my three inferences or observations of the data:
1.  There is almost a near positive correlation between the mouse's weight and the tumor volume.  In fact with a correlation coefficient at 0.95, it is almost certain that these two are positively correlated.
2.  On mouse ID s185, there was a significant decrease in the tumor volume over the time period.  The tumor volume on this mouse went from 45 cubic millimeters to less than 25 cubic millimeters, showing real promise for this drug.
3.  With the exception of 1 mouse on Infubinol, all four reigmens showed consistent results regarding the tumor volume of the mice at the end.  Looking at the box and whisker plot, Capomulin and Ramicane seemed to be the most promising of results with the tumor volumes taken at maximum time point having a median of less than 40 cubic millimeters.  Infubinol and Ceftamin still had median tumor volumes closer to 60 cubic millimeters.
